# alegira-fwi-linear-regression
This repo is for Module AML 3104 assingment 1. Here, I will process, and clean the dataset, generate visualizations, and derive insights from the Algerian forest fire dataset by analyzing the Fire Weather Index (FWI). This analysis will involve utilizing Linear Regression and its regularization techniques. Additionally, the assignment will include performing cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate the model's performance. I will also test the model on unseen data using pickle files.
